# Subscription.v - Software Testing Experience  

### **Role**: Software Tester  
**Project**: Subscription.v (Healthcare Plans & Bundles Platform)  

### **Overview**  
As a Software Tester for **Subscription.v**, I ensured a seamless user experience for customers subscribing to healthcare plans and bundles. My testing efforts focused on validating end-to-end functionality, including:  
- Product discovery and plan selection  
- User account management  
- Payment processing  

I conducted **manual** and **automated** tests to identify and resolve issues, improving system reliability.  

### **Testing Process**  
- **Test Planning & Design**: Created detailed test cases for functional, sanity, regression, API, and smoke testing (Web).  
- **Execution & Reporting**:  
  - Executed test cases and documented results.  
  - Identified, logged, and tracked bugs via **JIRA** until resolution.  
- **Collaboration**: Worked closely with developers and PMs to prioritize fixes.  

### **Key Contributions**  
✔ Enhanced subscription flow stability through rigorous regression testing.  
✔ Reduced critical bugs in payment processing by 30% via targeted test scenarios.  
✔ Improved test coverage by integrating automated scripts (e.g., Selenium/Postman).
